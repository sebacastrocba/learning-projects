# Acamica Data Science nanodegree repository
Projects developed during the Data Science course at [Acamica](https://www.acamica.com/)

**Project 01**
First model of machine learning.
This project challenged me to select a problem from a set of options, find out what data could help address it, perform an exploratory analysis, and train a simple Machine Learning model to solve it.

**Project 02**
Feature Engineering, Advanced Models and Model Interpretation.
Based on the project 01 I applied data transformation and train advanced models to further develop my Machine Learning models.

**Project 03**
Time Series project part I

**Project 04**
Final project: Time Series project part II
